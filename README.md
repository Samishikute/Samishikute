### So what does "Samishikute" even mean? Lonely, in Japanese. And we know that "Anything" is better if you add "in Japan" or "in Japanese"
   (I just like the word OK, I'm not lonely)
   Love Japanese music. My name comes from Aimer's song, "寂しくて眠れない夜は" (samishikute nemurenai yoru wa). More or less, "On a lonely, sleepless night"

This is where I will never post anything, but if I do it could be good. Maybe.

Highly interested in learning Infrastructure Engineering. Learning Ansible, with Terraform in the backlog.

Primary technology/platform interest: Windows Server, Red Hat, NetApp, Rubrik; MS Azure.

### 🤔 What about something that is not nerdy?

Love photography!
Love motorcycles!
Love tea!
Love piano and drums!
Love trying to make music - not good at it!
